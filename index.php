				<h3>Cost Management</h3>
                <p class="p0">Our in-house estimation team has been with us since the beginning. Our estimator’s market rates are constantly tested and updated based on regular trade prices we receive. The team fosters strong relationships with a healthy & reliable sub-contractor base and is a key part of Valmont’s proven methodology. The assurance every client received from market testing our designs at regular intervals in the upfront stages, is testament to our repeat business and proven track record with our clients.</p>
				<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
				<h3>Construction</h3>
                <p class="p0">Construction is where we began, so we know it intimately. Whether we’re undertaking a commercial fitout, a building refurbishment or a large retail offering , we bring our finely-tuned process and extensive experience to bear. 
				<br />	<br />	
					Firstly, the construction team is involved with every project starting from the initial design phase , bringing critical input and pragmatic strategies to creative thinking and ensuring we maintain cost control throughout.
				<br /> <br />	
					Secondly, this holistic ethos can be carried forward without the worry of subsequent compromise or cost-overrun during the construction process, as each team, each person on the project is working to the same delivery structure, the same project objectives and the same physical outcome.
				<br /> <br />	
					Overarching the entire process is our total commitment to the highest standards of communication, safety, quality and environmental efficiency.</p>
				<p class="p0">&nbsp;</p>
				<h3>Project Delivery</h3>
                <p class="p0">The success of a project lies in the hands of those who deliver it. At Valmont we are only too aware of the importance of seamless procurement and delivery. Our clients are assured they’re in entirely capable, experienced hands no matter the size of your project. We place a strong emphasis on building relationships with key points of contact prior to a project commencing, and maintaining those relationships at every stage of the delivery. From procurement to contract administration, programme management to trade negotiations, our experienced team works with you to keep you informed and up to date with each stage of your project..</p>
